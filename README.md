> D-Bug's strategy app for iPad

This repository holds our strategy iPad app for the 2018 FIRST Power Up season, built using Swift for iOS 11+

## Features
 - Search data by team number
 - Look back on data from past events
 - Scale, Switch and Exchange Cubes per Game graphs
 - Autonomous statistics
 - Scouter comments view
 - Rankings view for alliance picking

## TODO
 - [ ] Move to use WebSockets instead of regular HTTP requests for realtime data exchange
 - [ ] Adapt the app's layout to iPhone and other iPad models
 - [ ] Make the app's logic more game-agnostic
